Machine Learning Source Codes and Models

===========
CONVNET :
==========

 	keras-cifar10 	
  
  convnet (without tuning) using cifar10 datasets to recognize object in image
  
  - cifar10-predict.py
  
  - cifar10-train.py 
	
  - cifar10convnet.h5
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  mask-rcnn
  
  convolutional neural network with image segmentation
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  vgg16-saying-object
  
  recognize object in image using pretrained vgg16 (without image segmentation)
 
  
  pretrained convnet model from https://github.com/fchollet
  with slight modification at _obtain_input_shape for keras 2.1.6
  
  
=======
LSTM :
=======

  
  seq2seq-engindo
  
  simple seq2seq model for translating english to indonesia.
  dataset contains 3000 words.
